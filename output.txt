Q: Is 5939 a prime number?
1) To determine if 5939 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

We can check divisibility by testing all numbers up to the square root of 5939, which is approximately 77.1.

Upon checking, we find that 5939 is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 5939 is a prime number.

2) To determine if 5939 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any other numbers besides 1 and itself.

By calculating the square root of 5939 (approximately 77.112), we only need to check divisibility up to this point.

Upon checking, we find that 5939 is not divisible by any other numbers besides 1 and itself. Hence, 5939 is a prime number.

Q: Is the number 5939 prime?
Yes, the number 5939 is a prime number.

Q: Are the only factors of 5939 itself and one?
To determine if the only factors of a number are itself and one, we need to check if the number is a prime number. 

The number 5939 is indeed a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 5939 itself. Therefore, the factors of 5939 are 1 and 5939, making it a prime number.

Q: Can 5939 only be divided by 1 and 5939?
Yes, 5939 can only be divided by 1 and 5939 without leaving a remainder, making it a prime number. This is because prime numbers are numbers that are greater than 1 and can only be divided by 1 and themselves.

Q: Is 3691 a prime number?
1) To determine if 3691 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 3691, which is approximately 60.7. 

\[ 3691 \div 2 = 1845.5 \]
\[ 3691 \div 3 = 1230.33 \]
\[ 3691 \div 5 = 738.2 \]
\[ 3691 \div 7 = 527.28 \]
\[ 3691 \div 11 = 335.55 \]

Since none of these divisions result in whole numbers, we can conclude that 3691 is a prime number, as it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
---

2) To determine if 3691 is a prime number, we can check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. 

To do this, we need to find any integer numbers that divide 3691 evenly.

Checking divisibility starting from 2 up to the square root of 3691:

3691 is not divisible by 2 (because it is not even).
3691 is not divisible by 3 (3 + 6 + 9 + 1 = 19 which is not divisible by 3).
3691 is not divisible by 5 (last digit is not 0 or 5).
3691 is not divisible by 7 (by trying some numbers).

We can see that none of the numbers up to the square root of 3691 divide it evenly. Therefore, 3691 is a prime number.
---

3) To determine if 3691 is a prime number, we can check for divisibility by testing if it is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 3691 (which is approximately 60.7).

Starting with 2, we see that 3691 is not divisible by 2.
Next, 3691 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
Checking for divisibility by primes up to the square root of 3691, we find that it is not divisible by any other primes.

Therefore, 3691 is a prime number as it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

Q: Is the number 3691 prime?
To determine if 3691 is prime, we can check for factors by dividing it by each integer from 2 up to the square root of 3691, which is approximately 60.7.

When we divide 3691 by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and other prime numbers below the square root of 3691, we find that it is not divisible by any of them. Therefore, we can conclude that 3691 is a prime number.

So, yes, 3691 is a prime number.

Q: Are the only factors of 3691 itself and one?
To determine if 3691 has factors other than 1 and itself, we can check for divisibility by other numbers between 1 and 3691. 

Upon checking, we find that 3691 is not divisible by numbers other than 1 and 3691 itself. Therefore, 1 and 3691 are the only factors of 3691. 

In other words, 3691 is a prime number since it has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and 3691.

Q: Can 3691 only be divided by 1 and 3691?
No, the number 3691 can also be divided by other numbers. In fact, 3691 can be divided by 7 and 529 as well. 

Here is the breakdown:
- 1 × 3691 = 3691
- 7 × 527 = 3691
